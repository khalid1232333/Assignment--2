# Assignment 2 – Interactive Features

This is the **second phase** of my personal portfolio website for **ICS 344 (Web Engineering)**.  
It builds directly on my previous Assignment 1 and adds more **interactivity**, **data handling**, and **AI-assisted improvements**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this assignment is to practice using **JavaScript** and **CSS animations** to make the website more dynamic and user-friendly.  
Everything here was coded by me (Khalid Al-Anazi), with small AI-assisted parts documented in `docs/ai-usage-report.md`.

---

## 🧩 Features Implemented
| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Dynamic Greeting** | Changes the welcome message based on the current time of day. |
| **Dark/Light Mode Memory** | Saves the theme preference in `localStorage` so it remembers when reloading. |
| **Live Search Bar** | Filters projects instantly while typing. |
| **Form Validation & Feedback** | Validates user input and shows success/error messages. |
| **Fade-In Animations** | Smooth fade-in on scroll for project cards. |
| **AI Assistance** | Used ChatGPT for code suggestions, documentation, and design review. |

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- **HTML (index.html):** Defines the structure (About Me, Projects, Contact).  
- **CSS (styles.css):** Contains purple theme, transitions, and animations.  
- **JavaScript (script.js):** Handles logic for greeting, theme toggle, search, and form validation.
